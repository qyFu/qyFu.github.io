<h1>Caged Bird</h1>
<h2>BY MAYA ANGELOU</h2>
<p>A free bird leaps<br />on the back of the wind <br />and floats downstream <br />till the current ends<br />and dips his wing<br />in the orange sun rays<br />and dares to claim the sky.</p>
<p>But a bird that stalks<br />down his narrow cage<br />can seldom see through<br />his bars of rage<br />his wings are clipped and <br />his feet are tied<br />so he opens his throat to sing.</p>
<p>The caged bird sings <br />with a fearful trill <br />of things unknown <br />but longed for still <br />and his tune is heard <br />on the distant hill <br />for the caged bird <br />sings of freedom.</p>
<p>The free bird thinks of another breeze<br />and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br />and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br />and he names the sky his own</p>
<p>But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams <br />his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream <br />his wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br />so he opens his throat to sing.</p>
<p>The caged bird sings <br />with a fearful trill <br />of things unknown <br />but longed for still <br />and his tune is heard <br />on the distant hill <br />for the caged bird <br />sings of freedom.</p>
